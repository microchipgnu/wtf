# WTF (WiseTextFlow) -- Smart Natural Coding Language

WiseTextFlow (WTF) is an innovative, AI-driven natural coding language that makes programming more intuitive and user-friendly. Designed to work seamlessly with AI language models like GPT, WiseTextFlow enables developers to write code using a more natural and human-readable syntax. The .wtf file extension reflects the unique and unconventional approach of the project.

## Features
